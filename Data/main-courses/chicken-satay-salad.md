## Method

### Step 1

Pour the tamari into a large dish and stir in the curry powder, cumin, garlic and honey.

Mix well.

Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 fillets in total, then add to the marinade and mix well to coat.

Set aside in the fridge for at least 1 hr, or overnight, to allow the flavours to penetrate the chicken.

### Step 2

Mix the peanut butter with the chilli sauce, lime juice, and 1 tbsp water to make a spoonable sauce.

Wipe a large non-stick frying pan with a little oil, when ready to cook the chicken.

Add the chicken and cook, covered with a lid, for 5-6 mins on a medium heat, turning the fillets over for the last min, until cooked but still moist.

Set aside, covered, to rest for a few mins.

### Step 3

Toss the lettuce wedges with the cucumber, shallot, coriander and pomegranate, and pile onto plates, while the chicken rests.

Spoon over a little sauce.

Slice the chicken, pile on top of the salad and spoon over the remaining sauce.

Eat while the chicken is still warm.
